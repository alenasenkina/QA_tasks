Before uploading your app to the Play Store, it is important to double check the points below to ensure that the integration is successful.
1. INTEGRATION – ARE DEVICES REGISTERING WITH SAILTHRU MOBILE?
The best way to test if your SDK integration has been successful, is to navigate to Settings, Developer.
In this section you will see a list of devices that have registered against this app. If you have recently opened the app, then your device will likely be at the top of the list. If your device appears there, and has a Push Token, then your integration is likely successful.

2. ARE DEVICES RECEIVING PUSH TOKENS?
To confirm that your app is receiving Push Tokens, Navigate to Settings, Developer. Click on any device in the device list, and confirm there is a token in the "Push Token" field.

Not receiving Push Tokens?
Did you create your App Store Provisioning Profile after setting up Push on the App ID? It is extremely important that the App Store provisioning profile is created or regenerated after setting up Push on the App ID.

3. HAVE YOU INTEGRATED A MESSAGE STREAM?
A Message stream needs to be integrated and accessible into your app. It is strongly recommended that you also put an 'unread' label/badge as an overlay on your Message Stream CTA, to ensure that users are aware there is new content in the Message Stream.

4. Are you receiving Custom Events and User Attributes?
Check that custom events are appearing by navigating to Analytics, Events. Events should then appear in the dropdown list. To makes sure your Attributes are appearing, try create an Audience by navigating to Audiences, Create Audience. Your user attributes should appear in the Audience Builder.

5. HAVE YOU UPLOADED A DISTRIBUTION APNS CERTIFICATE TO SAILTHRU MOBILE?
Visit the 'Developer' tab of your app, under the 'Settings' section and ensure that you have uploaded a distribution and development certificate. Instructions on how to create and upload the certificate can be found in Push Notifications for iOS.

6. AFTER SUBMITTING YOUR APP TO THE APP STORE
To be certain your App Store binary is push enabled, one completed the upload of your binary, go to the 'Binary Details' section for your latest upload. Towards the bottom of the page there should be a section called 'Entitlements'. Make sure that there is an item in this section that reads 'aps-environment: production'.

NOTES & PRACTICES:
A developer can submit the app and opt for "developer release" which means the app is not automatically made available to the public untill the developer choose to.

Don't stress too much on SKU number. It can be any string (it shohuld make sense to you)

choose bundle Identifier wisely
Format: com.company.app-vertical
eg: com.apple.pages

AFTER SUBMISSION
- App is reviewed by apple review team
- It takes 3 hours to 7+ (working) days for app to be reviewed
- For first time upload, it may take more than 3 days.
APP REJECTION
- App rejection is not a "cul-de-sac". So fix the issues and re submit

Your app may be rejected due to following (popular) reasons:
- App has a login screen but no signup page. (need to provide clarification)
- Developers have used any private api (like giniee animation effect)
- App crashes very often.
