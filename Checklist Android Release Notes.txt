Android Release Checklist

Before uploading your app to the Play Store, it is important to double check the points below to ensure that the integration is successful.

1. Are devices registering with Sailthru Mobile?
The best way to test if your SDK integration has been successful is to Navigate to Settings, Logs, Device Log.

In this section you will see a list of devices that have registered against this app. If you have recently opened the app, then your device will likely be at the top of the list. If your device appears there, then your integration is likely successful.

2. Are devices receiving Push Tokens?
To confirm that your app is receiving Push Tokens, Navigate to Settings, Logs, Device Log. Click on any device in the device list, and confirm there is a token in the "Push Token" field.

3. Are you receiving Custom Events and User Attributes?
Check that custom events are appearing by navigating to Analytics, Events. Events should then appear in the dropdown list. To makes sure your Attributes are appearing, try create an Audience by navigating to Audiences, Create Audience. Your user attributes should appear in the Audience Builder.

4. Have you added the FCM key to your app on Sailthru Mobile?
Sailthru Mobile requires a FCM key from the Firebase Console in order to authorize Sailthru Mobile with your project and send push messages to devices running your app.

Instructions on setting up a Firebase Console project and obtaining a FCM key can be found Push Notifications for Android.

5. Have you integrated and customized the Message Stream?
A Message stream needs to be integrated into your app, and accessible via a button. It is strongly recommended that you also put an 'unread' label/badge as an overlay, to ensure that users are aware there is new content in the Message Stream.
